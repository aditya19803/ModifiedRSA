# ModifiedRSA
This project is an implementation of a Modified RSA algorithm described in IEEEXplore which use a third prime number in order to make a modulus n which is not easily decomposible by intruders. The key parameters of algorithm are stored locally before the computation on input message to increase the speed of computation.
